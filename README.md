# Nougat development has temporarily halted.
I, @Dogo6647, have decided to stop working on Nougat, the spec, and the compiler directly... for now.
<br><br>
The goal of Nougat is to enable easier and faster "real" development for beginner programmers who just haven't gotten used to
the rest of what's being offered out there, so @PwLDev and I have now moved our focus over to the [Scratch Everywhere!](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere) project and its organization,
which has a very similar goal to ours; Aiming to port the Scratch runtime to game consoles and other devices, enabling easier homebrew development for everyone, anywhere.
<br><br>
This doesn't mean Nougat's development will be canceled or anything, it just means that we might not follow up with it until we find the right time and circumstances to do so. Nougat is currently
a passion project only being developed by two individuals, so that's a contributing factor. However, I'm working on getting a full-on Nougat interpreter in my upcoming UGC game's level editor, 
so that's cool, I guess.
